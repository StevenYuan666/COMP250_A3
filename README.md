# Cat Cafe
Have just been named CEO of a chain of Cat Cafes. A cat cafe is a coffee shop in which cats are roaming and interact with customers. At the time of my promotion, I am informed that the chain does not have any repository of the cats, and maintain no information about their seniority. I am extremely upset upon hearing this as I understand those cats are my most important staff members and, like any other employees, deserve salary and working conditions that improve with seniority.

The database of all cats is represented by a ternary tree CatTree. This tree has a single field root which contains a reference to the root node. The nodes are defined by a private nested class CatNode. Each CatNode is associated with data stored in a CatInfo object.
